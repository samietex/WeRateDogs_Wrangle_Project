# Wrangle-Project---WeRate-Dogs

## Project Overview

### Introduction

The objective of this data wrangling project is to gather different data from a variety of sources in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. For this project I used the Python programming language and some other Python libraries. You will get more details on this as you continue with this documentation.

### Dataset Overview

The datasets used for this project is from the WeRateDogs Twitter handle. I performed some data analysis and visualization on the data. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

### Tasks

In the course of this project, I did some gathering of datasets, and cleaning of the dataset. I will be dividing this section into: 

* Gathering of data
* Assess data
* Cleaning of data


**Gathering of data**  - In this step, I gathered all 3 different data from different sources: The WeRateDogs Twitter Archive CSV file, the tweet image prediction TSV file, and the additional data from the Twitter API.

**Assess data** - After gathering the different data from their sources, I tried to assess the data visually and programmatically to get more insights in quality and tidiness issues.

**Cleaning of data** - Now that the I have visually and programmatically assessed the data, I then proceeded to clean the data using the Python programming language and some libraries. The libraries I used are:

* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib.pyplot
* Seaborn
